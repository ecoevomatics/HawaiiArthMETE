Question: Is there a pattern in deviation from MaxEnt? 
Hypothesis: Local speciation and adaptation drive divergence at intermediate time scales 

Plots: 
Deviation vs. proportion that are single island endemic 
Deviation vs. proportion that are invasive 
Deviation vs. ages of sites 
Deviation vs. macro-states: Species, Individuals, Biomass 
Comparing ecological simiiarites and deviation from MaxEnt between sites 
Deviation in the number of rare species in data vs. MaxEnt compared across sites (age)
